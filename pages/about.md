We're developing sustainable processes for import of [IATI data](http://aidtransparency.net) into Bangladesh's [Aid Information Management System (AIMS)](http://aims.erd.gov.bd/)

The [Terms of Reference](http://jobs.undp.org/cj_view_job.cfm?cur_job_id=57889) for this work outline the original specifications for the work and originally envisaged a pilot with 3 donors. Instead of a limited pilot, we will put in place a sustainable and scalable process for IATI data import.
