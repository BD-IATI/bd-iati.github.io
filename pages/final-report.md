This report follows on from the inception report concluded on 17th October 2015. It is informed by a mission to Dhaka in October 2015, which included ten meetings with development partners and five meetings with government staff, as well as numerous informal conversations in the Ministry of Finance. This was followed by three further missions to Dhaka (in February, April and June 2016), when the focus was on software development.
