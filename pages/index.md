# Developing sustainable processes for IATI import

Development partners have published a large amount of data on their aid activities through the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI). We're going to start using IATI data in Bangladesh's Aid Information Management System (AIMS).

The aim is to improve the quality of the data held in the AIMS and reduce the burden of data collection.
