Documentation on the link between the different financial flows in the Bangladesh AIMS and how to match and insert IATI data.

+ Project Value
+ Committments
+ Planned disbursements
+ Actual Disbursements
+ Expenditure

Disbursements (both planned and actual) are linked to committments (which are actually the value of financing agreements)

Is each expenditure linked to a disbursement? It looks like expenditures are linked to loan/grant agreements, unclear how this can be as if the disbursement is made to an implementer, that is all the one pot, so at most, the expenditure can be linked to the withdrawal application, and then is made from the resulting disbursement but financially is one pot.
