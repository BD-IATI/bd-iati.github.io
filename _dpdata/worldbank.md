The World Bank administers a number of trust funds. It will be important to work out how to handle these trust funds in the data. 

Our understanding is that trust funds are currently not published in the World Bank's IATI data. The World Bank IATI data also contains financial data only one quarter (or more) in arrears - the latest data (as of 2016-01-27) was dated from `2015-09-30`. This is too old to be useful on an ongoing basis. Disbursement data is also aggregated by quarter; a minimum of monthly disaggregation would be preferable.
